# 👋 Hi, geeks!
_______________________________________________________________

I'm Marco P. , i introduce myself as a hobbist and self-taught guy with a scholastic background in electronics and some interest in software and other side topics, even though i wouldn't really qualify myself as a programmer. The nickname i chose in leet speech has double meaning, as it could be interpreted both as **Marco P. Code** and as a recall to the concept of **opcode**, the most basic instruction of any architecture. 
I use this account mainly for personal learning and related practice, therefore the totality of my public repos and most of the private ones will contain useful learning resources and academic lectures like lessons and exercises that i found on the public internet, so one can consult them for educational purposes.

I'm very passionate about everything related to STEM disciplines. I believe in research and technology as tools capable of bringing well-being into everyday life, empowering people and improving their knowledge. I think that it's a noble mission, deserving to be pursued with willingness and discipline. 
As Dante said "Consider your origins: you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge", so i let my curiosity guide myself, aware that generosity is the highest form of wisdom. This innate curiosity, to which i owe all my knowledge since ever, accompany me on my journey and i try to give my best to enlight my understanding at least on a daily basis.

### ☀️ some of my attributes:

🎓 **Self Taught Student** | 📚 **Lifelong Learner** | 💾 **Retrocomputing Modernist** | 🎧 **Eighties Enthusiast** | 🌌 **Tech Savvy** | 👽 **SciFi Fan** | 🗿 **Unresolved Thinker** | 🗺️ **Wanderlust Traveler** | 🌄 **Occasional Trekker** | 🔭 **Unexperienced Sky Watcher**

### 👀 my interests:

🌍 **Open Source** | 🐞 **Debugging** | 🧱 **Assembly Language** | 🔬 **Reverse Engineering** | 🛡️ **Infosec** | 🔒 **Cryptography** | 🔍 **Digital Forensics** | 🧠 **Computer Architectures** | 📡 **Telecommunications** | 🧩 **Embedded Systems**

### 🌱 culture and aspirations:
 
- improve my skills in order to broaden the frontier of my aptitudes, to achieve a technical mastery and a deep knowledge in as many disciplines as possible.
- know how to analyze hardware of any kind, even without knowing its specific applications.
- know how to acquire all the needed information on whatever device i see (architectural reference documentation, component datasheets, dynamic analyses) and understand its operating logic at an arbitrary level of detail and depth along the typical stack (physical, logical, protocol, software).
- be able to see everything about computer science through the lenses of an electronic technician, that tries to delve what is happening under the hood. Hardware is the cornerstone for the software.
- be able to derive simpler rules from complex situations. Approaching CS from scratch allows you to face a whole universe of very different things, starting from the most atomic and fundamental thing known, whether it's the **opcode** or whatever a meaningful rule is.
- know how the hardware is really programmed and how to have full control over it, for example know how a high-level software concept is spoken or translated in low-level stuff and expressed in the native ISA of any architecture.
- be able to reconstruct the logic and recognize the application context of any old software even if available as a black box, without knowing the development, working methods and interests of those who designed it, having partial, obsolete or untrusted documentation and despite the absence of source code.
- behave ethically, harmlessly and respectifully of others and of legitimate rights like copyright, intellectual property and privacy. I discourage any illicit purpose, it's not catholic.
- know how to look for defects, freeze them in a picture, reproduce them and understand their causes. How to document them.
- have a methodology for everything. That's because i believe that poor written code or the absence of a methodology unveils a certain lack of reasoning.
